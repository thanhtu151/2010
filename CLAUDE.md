# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This directory appears to be a clean workspace with only Claude Code configuration files. No specific project structure, source code, or configuration files were found during the analysis.

## Current State

- This is a fresh directory with minimal files
- Only `.claude/settings.local.json` exists, which contains Claude Code permissions
- No source code, package managers, or build systems detected
- Not a git repository

## Common Operations

Since this is a clean workspace, common operations would include:

- `git init` - Initialize a git repository
- `npm init` - Create a Node.js package.json file
- `mkdir <directory-name>` - Create project directories
- Standard file creation operations for setting up new projects

## Next Steps

This appears to be a newly created workspace ready for project initialization. Future instances should expect to work with setting up new projects rather than maintaining existing codebases.
